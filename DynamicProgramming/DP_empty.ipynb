    "### Actions\n",
    "Our world is a grid world. An agent can move the world travelling in four main directions, so four actions are possible:\n",
    "- 0 (up)\n",
    "- 1 (right)\n",
    "- 2 (down)\n",
    "- 3 (left)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each action moves us to the corresponding state. If it is impossible to be moved, we are staying in the same state. There is also a terminal state (marked red). Reaching a terminal state ends the episode.\n",
    "\n",
    "### States\n",
    "A state is a location of the agent. A standard way to describe the state is by using an instance of a `State` class. Such an object has two properties: `state.row` and `state.col` that are describing the position of the agent. Both rows and cols are counted from `0`, so the upper left corner corresponds to `(0, 0)` state. Another way of describing a state is by using a tuple `(row, col)`. Such a format is also accepted by methods implemented in a simulator.\n",

    "For each move a negative reward `Reward = -1` is granted. Aditionally, for entering each state a reward associated with this state is granted.\n",
